# Interview-Questions

This is a collection of topics, and questions I am reviewing for interview purposes as well as for my own understanding. 

# Initially speaking, what sticks topics stick out to me?

I have always found hashing of any sort to be so interesting, the fact that you can check if an element exists in constant time really piqued my interest in the subject. I also really enjoy Linked Lists, I see it as a topic that is not terribly complicated to understand, but a bit of a challenge to master and find it to be a  very dynamic data structure!

I found this course to be an excellent resource and would like to thank **DS Guy** for creating this course!
